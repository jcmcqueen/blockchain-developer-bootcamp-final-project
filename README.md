## <p align="center">Biomarker DAO</p>

## 1. Problem Statement

We live in a world where we are able to obtain a lot of information 

Examples include:
- Genetic information such as from 23andME
- Continuous blood glucose monitoring from devices such as a Dexom G6
- Oxygen monitoring
- our activity (e.g. # of steps)
- sleep patterns (ever tried SnoreLab?) 

Along with the profile of who we are this is valuable information.

## 2. Solution

Create a DAO where individuals are rewarded for contributing there information. The more diverse information they provide and more frequency results in more rewards (tokens). Researchers purchase the information through the purchase of token raising the value of the individual contributors.

## 3. Scope of Project
