## 1. Problem Statement

We are on the brink of personalized health breakthroughs that can target treatments based on our health profiles. Machine intelligence combined with large volumes of biomarker data can yield insights on health that were never available before. Collecting biomarker data is also easier than ever before. 

Examples include:
- Genetic information such as from 23andME
- Continuous blood glucose monitoring from devices such as a Dexom G6
- Oxygen monitoring
- our activity (e.g. # of steps)
- sleep patterns (ever tried SnoreLab?) 

This type of data is collected today but centralized with each technology vendor (for instance, data collected with an Oura ring is stored with Oura). Even though the same biomarker data might be collected (e.g. heart rate) it is siloed with each vendor. Imagine moving biomarker data on-chain. Each technolody vendor would write it to the chain. This makes it much easier to utlize the data and gives more ownership to the individual it was collected from. 
The issue is how do we motivate individuals to contribute their personal health data in order to derive these insights. Blockchain (along with some tokenomics) to the rescue.

## 2. Solution

Create a DAO where individuals are rewarded for contributing there information. The more diverse information they provide and more frequency results in more rewards (tokens). Researchers purchase the information through the purchase of token raising the value of the individual contributors.

## 3. Scope of Project

The goal of the project would be to utilize a couple key uses cases.

3.1 Use case one

An individual "signs up" with the DAO with completing an initial set of demographic information. This is information that does not (or rarely) changes such as birth date and biological sex.

3.2 Use case two

An existing user writes a set of bio-marker data such as timestamped weight.

3.3 Use case three

A pharma company requests access to a set of data by paying for it in the native token.

## 4. Implimentation details

No unique dependencies or additional resources are required.
